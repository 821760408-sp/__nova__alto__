A Slack->AlchemyAPI->Twitter Bot

Tweets questions and exclamations from my Slack team to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SlackyDan1985), post-processed through AlchemyAPI analysis.

This porject is intended to expose what I call the "institutionalization" of Twitter, or the art of constructing tweets in a specific way that produces nothing but eyesore.
